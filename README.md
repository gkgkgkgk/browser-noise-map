### Work in Progress #1 (10/11/19)

###### Map with Zoom and Fractal Sliders

The zoom of the noise on the map can be adjusted, as well as the amount of fractal noise iterations (weight amount) to use and the strength of the fractal noise (wieght multiplier).

### Work in Progress #2 (10/13/19)

###### Map with Rivers

Rivers are added to the map. Right now they just go from high points to low points in a straight line (when they can). Sinusoidal noise will be weighted in to make the rivers windy.
